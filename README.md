Atbash Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where the letters of the alphabet are reversed. For example, 'A' is substituted with 'Z', 'B' with 'Y', and so on.

def atbash_cipher(text):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char.isupper():
                result += chr(155 - ord(char))
            else:
                result += chr(219 - ord(char))
        else:
            result += char
    return result

# Example usage
text = "HELLO, World!"
encrypted = atbash_cipher(text)
decrypted = atbash_cipher(encrypted)  # Atbash is symmetric

print(f"Original text: {text}")
print(f"Encrypted text: {encrypted}")
print(f"Decrypted text: {decrypted}")

Explanation of the Atbash Cipher Code
Letter Reversal:

The ASCII values of the characters are adjusted to reverse their position in the alphabet.
Symmetric Encryption and Decryption:

The Atbash Cipher is symmetric, meaning the same function can be used for both encryption and decryption.
These alternative ciphers, Vigen√®re and Atbash, provide different levels of complexity and security compared to the Caesar Cipher and can be fun and educational to implement.
